### 👋  Hello there

I’m Joshua Powell, a designer and engineer. I love improving the developer experience by creating tools that help engineers and operators get more done at work.

I have fifteen years of experience building and leading teams responsible for the architecture, design, and engineering of software and distributed systems that help organizations work together.

I am currently at Broadcom, where I am a product designer working on various enterprise developer tools. Previously, I was a Design Manager at Honeywell Robotics. Our work focused on designing for industrial AI, robotics, and voice products. I served as Director of a digital creative studio for six years and before that Director of a small digital consultancy.
