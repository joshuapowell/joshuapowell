# ðŸ‘‹  Hello there

# I'm a designer and engineer who loves to create remarkable experiences for enterprise developers.

I have fifteen years of experience building and leading teams responsible for the architecture, design, and engineering of software and systems that help organizations work together.

Iâ€™m currently at Broadcom, where Iâ€™m a product designer working on various enterprise developer tools. Previously, I was a Design Manager at Honeywell Robotics. Our work focused on designing for industrial AI, robotics, and voice products. I served as Director of a digital creative studio for six years and before that Director of a small digital consultancy.
