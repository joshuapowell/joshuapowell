### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there

I'm Joshua Powell, a designer, and technologist. I love tinkering with electronics, IoT projects, and edge AI/ML. Some of my tinkerings have even turned into products.

I have ten years of experience building and leading teams responsible for the architecture, design, and engineering of software and distributed systems.

I was most recently a User Experience Manager for Honeywell Robotics. Our work focused on designing for industrial AI, robotics, and voice products. I served as Director of a digital creative studio for six years and before that Director of a small digital consultancy.
